## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open Browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 💡 How It Works

### Step 1: Prompt Analysis
- **Intent Detection**: Understand what user wants (generate, debug, explain, etc.)
- **Language Detection**: Identify programming language mentioned
- **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate task complexity (simple, medium, complex)
- **Requirements Extraction**: Find specific needs (comments, error handling, etc.)

### Step 2: Tool-Specific Optimization
- **For Copilot**: Adds language specification, requests detailed comments, ensures specificity
- **For Cursor**: Uses conversational language, adds file context, improves collaboration

### Step 3: Explanation Generation
- Shows before/after comparison
- Explains exactly what was changed and why
- Helps users learn to write better prompts

## 🔧 Example Optimizations

### Input: "Write a function to calculate factorial"
### Target: GitHub Copilot

**Original:**
```
Write a function to calculate factorial
```

**Optimized:**
```
Write a Python function to calculate factorial. Include detailed comments explaining each step. Provide a complete, working example.
```

**Explanations:**
1. Added 'Python' specification because GitHub Copilot works better with explicit language mentions
2. Added comment request because GitHub Copilot excels at generating well-documented code
3. Requested complete example because GitHub Copilot performs better with full context

## 🧠 How The AI Analysis Works

### 1. Intent Detection
```python
# Detects what user wants to accomplish:
"generate" → Creating new code
"debug" → Fixing existing code  
"explain" → Understanding code
"refactor" → Improving code structure
"review" → Getting feedback on code
```

### 2. Language Recognition
```python
# Identifies programming languages:
Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, SQL
# Uses keyword matching and code pattern recognition
```

### 3. Complexity Assessment
```python
# Evaluates task difficulty:
"simple" → Quick, straightforward tasks
"medium" → Functions, classes, moderate features
"complex" → Systems, applications, advanced concepts
```

### 4. Requirements Extraction
```python
# Finds specific needs:
- Comments and documentation
- Error handling and validation
- Testing requirements
- Performance optimization
- Code structure preferences
```

## 🔄 Adding New Tools

To add support for a new AI tool:

1. **Update `tool_knowledge.py`:**
   ```python
   "new_tool": {
       "name": "New Tool Name",
       "description": "What it does",
       "optimization_rules": ["Rule 1", "Rule 2"],
       "strengths": ["Strength 1", "Strength 2"],
       "preferred_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
   }
   ```

2. **Update `prompt_optimizer.py`:**
   ```python
   def _optimize_for_new_tool(self, prompt, analysis):
       # Add tool-specific optimization logic
       return optimized_prompt
   ```

## 🎯 Use Cases

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Flask Import Error**
```bash
# Problem: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
# Solution: Make sure virtual environment is activated and Flask is installed
pip install flask
```

**2. Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Problem: Port 5000 is already in use
# Solution: Change port in app.py or kill existing process
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Use different port
```

**3. Template Not Found**
```bash
# Problem: TemplateNotFound: index.html
# Solution: Make sure templates/ folder exists with index.html
# Check file structure matches documentation
```

**4. Static Files Not Loading**
```bash
# Problem: CSS/JS not working
# Solution: All styles are embedded in HTML, no external files needed
# Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
```
